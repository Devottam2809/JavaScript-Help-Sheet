# I have created this JavaScript help sheet using HTML and CSS, anyone can easily use this sheet to get a knowlegde of JavaScript.
# Not only this  one can directly copy code snippets (a functional copy button is present on top-right corner of every code snippet) from this to use it in his/her code so as to save time.
